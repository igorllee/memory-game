# Memory Game

> Status: In improvements

This project is part of my study on CSS animations. It is a simple memory game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Prerequisites

To run the game in a local environment, you need a modern web browser that supports the technologies used (HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript).

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/igorllee/memory-game.git
```

2. Navigate to the game directory:

```bash
cd memory-game
```

3. Finally, open the "index.html" file in your browser. This will start the memory game.

## Features

- The game board is randomly generated for each playthrough.
- When the player finds all matching card pairs, the game restarts for a new round.
